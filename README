Racket implementation of Python.

Overview
--------

We are testing our implementation against the unit tests of Python
3.2.3:

http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.3/

The source link is at:

http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.2.3/Python-3.2.3.tgz

The tests in python-reference/ were drawn from the unit tests in the
Lib/tests directory of that source bundle.

This Repo
---------

base/

  this contains our implementation of desugaring, interpreter

redex/

  this contains the semantic implementation of lambda-py

tests/

  this contains various tests - a regression suite in python-reference,
  and other tests.


Installation
------------

You will need Racket >= 5.3.3

http://download.racket-lang.org/all-versions.html

There are two additional files in this repo that are Racket packages lambda-py
uses.  Install them with:

> raco setup -A plai-typed-18Feb2013.plt
> raco setup -A ragg-mangled.plt

Then you should be able to build lambda-py itself:

> cd base/
> make

If you encounter any problems or have any other questions, send mail to
