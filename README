Racket implementation of Python.

Overview
--------

We are testing our implementation against the unit tests of Python
3.2.3:

http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.3/

The source link is at:

http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.2.3/Python-3.2.3.tgz

The tests in python-reference/ were drawn from the unit tests in the
Lib/tests directory of that source bundle.

This Repo
---------

base/

  this contains our implementation of desugaring, interpreter

redex/

  this contains the semantic implementation of lambda-py

tests/

  this contains various tests - a regression suite in python-reference,
  which are the tests that we report on in the paper. Other tests in this
  directory are ones that we haven't committed to checking regressions, and
  may or may not pass.


Installation
------------

You will need Racket >= 5.3.3

http://download.racket-lang.org/all-versions.html

There are two additional files in this repo that are Racket packages lambda-py
uses.  Install them with:

> raco setup -A plai-typed-18Feb2013.plt
> raco setup -A ragg-mangled.plt

Then you should be able to build lambda-py itself:

> cd base/
> make

If you encounter any problems or have any other questions, send mail to
lambda-py@googlegroups.com
