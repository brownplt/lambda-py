                            Multiple Inheritance

Introduction

Multiple Inheritance in Python is handled using the __mro__ tuple attribute in
clases, which is computed at class creation time using the C3 linearization
algorithm, if there is no C3 linearization possible, class creation fails with
TypeError: MRO conflict among bases.
Attribute retrieval follows the __mro__ sequential order instead of the single
inheritance order.

super() semantics is quite different from the single inheritance case since it
is designed to support cooperative multiple inheritance, basically attribute
lookup is done in __mro__ order, but skipping all classes up to thisclass,
where thisclass is the first argument to super() or the enclosing class in the
zero arguments case.

Modifications to base implementation

- Changes to VObject:
    The VObject used to represent a class needs two new attributes in its dict:
        1) __bases__: a tuple with the parents given during class creation or
                      object if no paret is given
        2) __mro__: a tuple with the results of the C3 linearization algorithm
    The "antecedent" field, which was used for the parent class name is
    redundant now and, since for instance objects it is used for the class name,
    it could be ranamed as "classname" with the value 'type (or any other type
    name if metaclass support is incorporated in the future) for class objects.

-  New syntax that you add to the core:
    CClass (base : symbol) parameter will be changed to allow a list of bases,
    represented as a list of base class names, expansion to the tuple of class
    is done at interpreter level to call the three argument version of type().

-  New surface syntax and changes in desugaring
   No new syntax but some changes needs to be made at desugaring:
   - the list of bases needs to be passed to CClass, not just the first element,
     as a list of symbols.
   - super needs the class in which it is embeded as an additional argument
     when it is called without arguments, since super() is already special-cased
     in desugar and a flag is carried-on to indicate when desugaring takes place
     inclass I plan to change that boolean to an optional class name.

-  Functions/helpers that already exist and and you change   
    In python-interp.rkt:
        interp-env: CClass case to retrieve the base classes and call the new
        function mk-type for class creation.
        get-field: to handle the new lookup order, uses get-field-from-obj and
        get field-from-cls.
    In util.rkt:
        object-is: modified to look at __mro__ for inheritance relation.

-  Functions/helpers that you add
    In python-interp.rkt:
        mk-type: class construction, it should handle type(name, bases, dict).
        build-mro:  merge the __mro__ of the bases using the C3 algorithm,
        raises TypeError if there are duplicated bases or linearization is not
        possible.
        c3-merge: implements the c3 algorithm to merge mro lists.
        c3-select: helper function to find the next candidate in c3 algorithm.
        get-field-from-obj: looks for a field of an object using the class __mro__
        skip up to thisclass in __mro__, if defined.
        get-field-from-cls: looks for a field of a class using class __mro__
        skip up to thisclass in __mro__, if defined.
        lookup-mro: looks for field in mro list
        is-special-method?: test for special methods
    In util.rkt:
        get-mro: retrieves the __mro__ attribute prepending the class, to avoid
        the need of self-reference.
        get-class: retrieves the class of an object.
        any: any of a list of boolean (used in the c3 mro algorithm)

- New builtin classes
    super:
        super is a class with two attributes: __thisclass__ and __self__,
        these parameters can be given explicitly or provided by desugaring when
        used inside a class (only the second option is implemented).
        When an attribute is retrieved from a super object the search is
        modified to use the __self__ class __mro__, but only past __thisclass__.
    method:
        bound method, __func__ is the function to be called and __self__ the
        bound object. mk_method function is used to generate instances of this class,
        it its called from get-field-from-obj and get-field-from-cls.
    classmethod:
        In classmethod objects __func__ is defined as instance attribute
        classmethod objects are converted to method objects 
        with class as __self__ on attribute retrieval        
    staticmethod:
        In staticmethod objects __func__ is defined as instance attribute
        staticmethod objects are converted to functions on attribute retrieval
    type:
        for the test set the one and three argument versions of type
        constructor are used, the first can be implemented using the $class
        primitive operation, but the second cannot use CClass, it is a more
        kind of operation.

-  Bugs fixed
    - bound/unbound methods: #12, #13, #23 and # 26
    - ___fail() changed to no parameter to match py-prelude.py

- Status (2013-01-08):
    Basic multiple inheritance is passing all python-reference tests and 5 of 7
    multiple inheritance tests, the 2 left are related to super and method
    objects which are not implemented yet.

- Status (2013-01-28):
    Multiple inheritance branch passes all python-reference tests with the new
    implementation of bound/unbound methods, classmethod/staticmethod and
    cooperative multiple inheritance with super().

-  Special notes (if any) for running your tests
    Object instatiation is not complete, in particular __new__ is not supported
    Inheritance from builtin classes is not supported.
    type(obj) and type(obj, cls, dict) are not supported
    This are all related and so test_multiple_inheritance.py doesn't work
