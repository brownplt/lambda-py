                            Multiple Inheritance

Introduction

Multiple Inheritance in Python is handled using the __mro__ tuple attribute in
clases, which is computed at class creation time using the C3 linearization
algorithm, if there is no C3 linearization possible, class creation fails with
TypeError: MRO conflict among bases.
Attribute retrieval follows the __mro__ sequential order instead of the single
inheritance order.

super() semantics is quite different from the single inheritance case since it
is designed to support cooperative multiple inheritance, basically attribute
lookup is done in __mro__ order, but skipping all classes up to thisclass,
where thisclass is the first argument to super() or the enclosing class in the
zero arguments case.

Modifications to base implementation

- Changes to VObject:
    The VObject used to represent a class needs two new attributes in its dict:
        1) __bases__: a tuple with the parents given during class creation or
                      object if no paret is given
        2) __mro__: a tuple with the results of the C3 linearization algorithm
    The "antecedent" field, which was used for the parent class name is
    redundant now and, since for instance objects it is used for the class name,
    it could be ranamed as "classname" with the value 'type (or any other type
    name if metaclass support is incorporated in the future) for class objects.

-  New syntax that you add to the core:
    CClass (base : symbol) parameter will be changed to allow a list of bases,
    probably as a list of references to classes, not symbols to allow the three
    argument version of type() implementation.

-  New surface syntax and changes in desugaring
   No new syntax but some changes needs to be made at desugaring:
   - the list of bases needs to be passed to CClass, not just the first element.
     Alse it seems better
   - super needs the class in which it is embeded as an additional argument
     when it is called without arguments, since super() is already special-cased
     in desugar and a flag is carried-on to indicate when desugaring takes place
     inclass I plan to change that boolean to an optional class name.

-  Functions/helpers that already exist and and you change
   At interpreter level I would need to change:
   CClass case in interp-env to add the new attributes
   get_field to handle the new lookup order, including super as special case

-  Functions/helpers that you add
   mro, c3-merge and c3-select for __mro__ calculation.

- New builtin classes
    super:
        super is a class with two attributes: __thisclass__ and __self__,
        these parameters can be given explicitly or provided by desugaring when
        used inside a class.
        When an attribute is retrieved from a super object the search is
        modified to use the __self__ class __mro__, but only past __thisclass__.

    type:
        for the test set only the one and three argument versions of type
        constructor are used, the first can be implemented using the $class
        primitive operation and the second using CClass.

-  Bugs to be fixed
    bound methods / class method behavior: a method class needs to be defined,
    I will also look up at the descriptor protocol to see if it can be used.

-  Special notes (if any) for running your tests
    I plan 3 phases which can be tested incrementally:
    1) multiple inheritance support plus type class without changing super()
    2) modify super() to be multiple inheritance aware
    3) fix methods binding behavior / introduce descriptors
