    <h3>What this Document Covers</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Starting the lambda-py virtual machine and verifying the paper's results</li>
      <li>Exploring the lambda-py implementation and tests</li>
      <li>Building lambda-py from scratch</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <p>
    The virtual machine is in the <code>vm</code> directory of this archive as
    <code>lambda-py.vmdk</code>.  You can start it via VirtualBox by [FILL
    VirtualBox starting instructions].
    </p>

    <p>There is one useful user on the virtual machine, <code>reviewer</code>,
    with <code>sudo</code> privileges and password <code>reviewer</code>.  When
    the machine starts, enter these credentials and you should be presented
    with a desktop that looks like:

    [FILL screenshot]
    </p>

    <p>The files for review are all in the directory
    <code>/home/reviewer/lambda-py</code>.  The implementation and tests for
    lambda-py at artifact submission time are in
    <code>lambda-py-artifact-submission</code>.  We focus on the current state
    of the implementation, which enjoys some significant improvements over the
    implementation at submission time.  It passes all the same tests as the
    submission-time version and more, but we include the version from
    submission time with instructions (at the end of this document) for
    completeness.</p>

    <p>Our first goal should be to simply verify the results from Figure 12 in
    the paper.  Open a terminal ("Applications Menu" at the top left, then
    "Terminal Emulator"), and let's first run a very small test so we can find
    out if anything goes wrong right away (if you have the opportunity to ask
    the authors for help, we're putting this here for quick diagnosis): </p>

    <pre>
$ cd lambda-py/lambda-py-artifact-submission
$ echo "print('lambda-py works')" | racket python-main.rkt --interp
lambda-py works
    </pre>

    <p> This should take a few seconds to run, and confirms that the lambda-py
    interpreter is up and running for you.</p>

    <p>To run all the tests that we report in the paper, you can run:</p>

    <pre>
$ racket python-main.rkt --test ../../lambda-py-oopsla2013/tests/python-reference/
175 tests succeeded
0 tests failed
    </pre>

    <p>This runs the tests that we report in the paper using the current
    implementation.  This will take around an hour, depending on your machine.
    We provide a perl script called <code>cloc</code> to count the lines of
    code in each directory of <code>python-reference</code> (the "Built-in
    Datatypes" count is the combination of the directories function, bool,
    builtin, tuple, lists, and dict, "Iteration" is the combination of
    directories iter and range, and "(Multiple) Inheritance" is the combination
    of directories super and multiple-inheritance).</p>

    <p>We've added an additional suite of features via desugaring since
    submission time, documented in CHANGES.txt.  The new test cases are in the
    <code>tests/python-reference</code> subdirectory of
    <code>lambda-py-artifact-submission</code>.  So if you run the following,
    you will see the additional tests passing: </p>

    <pre>
$ racket python-main.rkt --test ../tests/python-reference/
[FILL] tests succeeded
0 tests failed
    </pre>

    <p>The repository is also set up to run all the same tests using Python.
    We've included an installation of Python 3.2.3 (the version we are
    modelling) in the VM, and these tests can be run with:</p>

    <pre>
$ racket python-main.rkt --python-path ~/install-stuff/Python-3.2.3/python --test-py ../tests/python-reference
    </pre>

    <p>That's enough to get started and verify what's in the paper, and some
    of what we've worked on since then.</p>

<h3>Looking Around</h3>

    <h4>Code from the paper</h4>

    <p>Many of the discussions in the paper directly correspond to a few places
    in the code; it is useful to see how they translate.  These are presented
    as links to Github sources, since they have a nice viewer for the
    files.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>The Redex definition of the language (which is also used to typeset
      the paper's code examples) is in <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/redex/lambdapy-core.rkt">lambda-py-core.rkt</a>,
      and the definition of the reduction steps and related metafunctions
      (which are also used to typeset the semantics shown in the paper) are in
      <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/redex/lambdapy-reduction.rkt">lambda-py-reduction.rkt</a>.
      The <code>redex/</code> directory contains a number of tests for these.
      </li>

      <li>The interpreter implementation (dubbed λ<sub>π↓</sub> in the paper)
      defines its abstract syntax in <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/base/python-core-syntax.rkt"><code>python-core-syntax.rkt</code></a>,
      which is simply an encoding in Racket structs of the AST from
      <code>lambda-py-core.rkt</code>.   Similarly,
      <code>python-interp.rkt</code> is a (much) more efficiently
      implementation of the reduction relation from
      <code>lambda-py-reduction.rkt</code>.
      </li>


      <li> A number of straightforward operator desugarings are in <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/base/python-desugar.rkt#L371"><code>python-desugar.rkt</code></a>.
      </li>

      <li> The composition of all the steps of scope desugaring is split
      between <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/base/python-phase1.rkt#L147"><code>python-phase1.rkt</code></a>,
      which marks global variables and instance variables from classes and
      rewrites rewrites class bodies, and <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/base/python-phase2.rkt#L19"><code>python-phase2.rkt</code></a>,
      which desugars all identifiers down to either local or global variables.
      These do other less fundamental work that doesn't appear in the paper for
      straightforward desugarings of default arguments and decorators.</li>

      <li>The CPS transformation and code for the skeleton in Figure 11 are in
      the file <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/base/python-cps.rkt#L379"><code>python-cps.rkt</code></a>
      </li>

      <li>We try to push functionality out of Racket and into
      Python-implemented libraries (with some macros, as indicated in Section
      6.2).  These are in the <code>base/pylib/</code> directory.  For example
      the <code>object</code> and <code>type</code> base classes implement a
      whole bunch of built-in functionality; they are implemented in Python
      with macros for primitive operators, at <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/base/pylib/type.py"><code>type.py</code></a>
      and <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/blob/master/base/pylib/object.py"><code>object.py</code></a>.
      </li>

      
    </ul>

    <p>As noted in the paper, lambda-py isn't quite to the point of running
    Python's full <code>unittest</code> library, so these tests use a limited
    language of assertions.  For example, if we look at
    <code>tests/python-reference/multiple-inheritance/methods.py</code>, we see
    lines like:

    <pre>
___assertEqual(Foo.getx(foo), 1)
    </pre>

    The implementation of <code>___assertEqual</code> is Python code that
    simply checks that the arguments are equal according to Python's
    <code>==</code> operator, and its implementation is in
    <code>base/py-prelude.py</code>.


    <h4>Playing around with lambda-py</h4>

    <p>It's easy to tweak the Python-implemented libraries of lambda-py to see
    what their effects are on Python programs.  Since these libraries implement
    so much built-in behavior, tweaking them can have interesting effects.  You
    can run individual Python programs through lambda-py by passing them
    through standard input and using the <code>--interp</code> option:</p>
    
    <pre>
$ racket python-main.rkt --interp &lt; some-python-file.py
    </pre>
    
    <p>Some things you might try:</p>

    <ul>
    
      <li>Change the definition of the <code>__str__</code> method in
      <code>pylib/dict.py</code> and run a simple program like <code>print({'x':5})</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Change the definition of the <code>__getitem__</code> method on a
      built-in type like <code>pylib/list</code> or <code>pylib/dict</code> and
      see the effects on lookup statements like <code>print([1,2,3][0])</code>.
      Similarly, change <code>__add__</code> or <code>__sub__</code> and see
      the effect on <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> expressions.</li>

      <li>Change the behavior of the various <code>__getattribute__</code>
      functions in <code>pylib/object.py</code> and see how it affects simple
      attribute lookup

    </ul>


    


    <h3>Building from Scratch</h3>

    <p>These instructions are included so reviewers can see the build process
    for lambda-py on their own machines.  Reviewers should be able to evaluate
    the artifact's performance relative to the paper from the VM, but a manual
    installation helps demonstrate that the artifact is easy to install and
    extend.</p>

    <p>
    The code for lambda-py is available at <a
      href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py">https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py</a>.
    </p>

    <p> We have two points in the repository's history that may interest
    reviewers:  One at the time of our OOPSLA submission (28 March, 2013), and
    one at the time of our artifact submission (1 June 2013).  They are tagged
    in the repository as <code>oopsla2013</code> and <code>[FILL]
      oopsla2013-ae</code>.
    </p>

    <h5>Getting Racket</h5>

    <p>Both require that you install Racket; the main download link at <a
      href="http://racket-lang.org/download/">http://racket-lang.org/download/</a>
    has installers for many platforms.  We have tested on several different
    Ubuntus from 11.04 to 12.10, and on OSX, with both Racket 5.3.3 and Racket
    5.3.4.  For review, we recommend Racket 5.3.4.  Download the installer and
    run it; you can pick any of the options for installing Racket (for example,
    you can install UNIX-style in <code>/usr/</code>, or keep the installation
    in your home directory).  In the instructions that follow, we assume that
    the <code>$PATH</code> environment variable is pointing to the
    <code>bin/</code> directory of the Racket installation that holds the
    <code>raco</code> and <code>racket</code> commands (this may be done for
    you automatically depending on which options you choose in the Racket
    installer).  </p>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    <pre>
$ wget http://download.racket-lang.org/installers/5.3.4/racket/racket-5.3.4-bin-i386-linux-ubuntu-karmic.sh
$ sh racket-5.3.4-bin-i386-linux-ubuntu-karmic.sh
    </pre>

    <h5>Getting the Source of Lambda-py</h5>

    <p>Github is the easiest way to get a copy of the code:</p>

    <pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py
    </pre>

    <p>
    Please <b>DO NOT</b> fork the repository on Github, as it will leak your
    identity to us.
    </p>

    <h4>Artifact Submission-time Build</h4>

    <li><p><b>PLAI-Typed:</b>  Lambda-py is built in a language that sits on
    top of Racket called plai-typed.  We have it included with the repository
    as <code>plai-typed-18Feb2013.plt</code> in the root of the repository.  To
    install it, use the <code>raco</code> command:</p>

    <pre>
$ raco setup -A plai-typed-18Feb2013.plt
    </pre>
    </li>

    <li><p><b>Ragg:</b></p>  Since publication, we had a third-party
    contribution of a pure Racket parser for Python (see <a
    href="https://github.com/brownplt/lambda-py/commit/ef26e932e7f7f10b3273ec618e7b819f91ca1acf">this
    merge</a>).  It uses the Ragg parser package for Racket; to install it, use
    the <code>raco</code> command:</p>

    <pre>
$ raco setup -A ragg-mangled.plt
    </pre>

    <li><p><b>Building:</b>  The implementation of lambda-py is in the
    <code>base/</code> directory.  To build, simply build the :</p>

    <pre>
$ cd base
$ make
    </pre>

    
    <h4>Paper Submission-time Build</h4>

    <p><em>We recommend using the provided virtual machine to review the code
      as it was at submission time, since it involves additional build steps
      that we have since made much easier.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Python</b>

    <p>At the time of submission, we used Python's parser to get original ASTs
    for desugaring (we have since switched to a pure-Racket Python parser).
    So, to run tests at the <code>oopsla2013</code> tag, you will also need to
    install Python3 (source is available at <a
      href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.3/">http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.3/</a>).
    </p>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    <pre>
$ wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.2.3/Python-3.2.3.tgz
$ tar xzf Python-3.2.3.tgz
$ cd Python-3.2.3
$ ./configure
$ make
    </pre>
    </li>


    <li>
    <p>To view the code as it was at submission time, check out the <code>oopsla2013</code> tag:</p>

    <pre>
$ git checkout oopsla2013
    </pre>

    </li>

    <li><p><b>PLAI-Typed:</b>  Lambda-py is built in a language that sits on
    top of Racket called plai-typed.  We have it included with the repository
    as <code>plai-typed-18Feb2013.plt</code> in the root of the repository.  To
    install it, use the <code>raco</code> command:</p>

    <pre>
$ raco setup -A plai-typed-18Feb2013.plt
    </pre>
    </li>

    <li><p><b>Running:</b>  To run the tests that were reported in the paper, run:</p>

    <pre>
